/** 1. Introduction to asynchronous programming:-

 * In traditional, synchronous programming, code is executed line by line, and each line must complete before the next one can execute.
 * Asynchronous programming, on the other hand, allows multiple operations to occur simultaneously, without blocking the execution of the main thread.
 *  This is useful for tasks that may take a long time to complete, such as fetching data from a server or performing complex calculations.

 ** 2. Callback functions:-

 * One way to perform asynchronous operations in JavaScript is to use callback functions.
 * A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed when the other function completes.
*/
//*  For example:-
    function getInformation(callBackFunction){
        setTimeout(()=>{
            let allData = {name:"Abhishek",rno:01};
            callBackFunction(allData);
        },2500)
    }
    getInformation((allData)=>{
        console.log(allData);   //after 2.5 sec, output:{name: 'Abhishek', rno: 1}
    })
//In this example, the "getInformation()" function simulates fetching data from a server using the "setTimeout()" function.
// It takes a "callBackFunction" function as an argument, which is executed with the fetched data after a delay of 2 seconds.

/** 3. Problems with callback functions:-

 * While callback functions are a useful tool for asynchronous programming,
 * they can lead to problems such as "callback hell" (nested callback functions that can be difficult to read and debug)
 *  and difficulty handling errors.
*/

/** 4. Introduction to promises:-

// Promises are an alternative to callback functions for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
* A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation,
* and allows for more readable and maintainable code.
*/

//* For example:-

function fetchInfo(){
    return new Promise((reject, resolve)=>{
        setTimeout(() => {
            const data={myName:"Rohit", Age:23};
            resolve(data);
        }, 1000);
    })
}
fetchInfo()
        .then(valueAsData => console.log(valueAsData))
        .catch(reasonForError => console.log(reasonForError));
    
//In this example, the fetchData() function returns a promise that resolves with the fetched data after a delay of 2 seconds.
// We can then use the then() method to handle the resolved value, and the catch() method to handle any errors that may occur.
