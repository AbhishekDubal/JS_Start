/** 1. Introduction to asynchronous programming:-

 * In traditional, synchronous programming, code is executed line by line, and each line must complete before the next one can execute.
 * Asynchronous programming, on the other hand, allows multiple operations to occur simultaneously, without blocking the execution of the main thread.
 *  This is useful for tasks that may take a long time to complete, such as fetching data from a server or performing complex calculations.

 ** 2. Callback functions:-

 * One way to perform asynchronous operations in JavaScript is to use callback functions.
 * A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed when the other function completes.
*/
//*  For example:-
    function getInformation(callBackFunction){
        setTimeout(()=>{
            let allData = {name:"Abhishek",rno:01};
            callBackFunction(allData);
        },2500)
    }
    getInformation((allData)=>{
        console.log(allData);   //after 2.5 sec, output:{name: 'Abhishek', rno: 1}
    })
//In this example, the "getInformation()" function simulates fetching data from a server using the "setTimeout()" function.
// It takes a "callBackFunction" function as an argument, which is executed with the fetched data after a delay of 2 seconds.

/** 3. Problems with callback functions:-

 * While callback functions are a useful tool for asynchronous programming,
 * they can lead to problems such as "callback hell" (nested callback functions that can be difficult to read and debug)
 *  and difficulty handling errors.
*/

/** 4. Introduction to promises:-

// Promises are an alternative to callback functions for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
* A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation,
* and allows for more readable and maintainable code.
*/

//* For example:-

function fetchInfo(){
    return new Promise((reject, resolve)=>{
        setTimeout(() => {
            const data={myName:"Rohit", Age:23};
            resolve(data);
        }, 1000);
    })
}
fetchInfo()
        .then(valueAsData => console.log(valueAsData))
        .catch(reasonForError => console.log(reasonForError));
    
//In this example, the fetchData() function returns a promise that resolves with the fetched data after a delay of 2 seconds.
// We can then use the then() method to handle the resolved value, and the catch() method to handle any errors that may occur.

/** 5. Introduction to async/await:

 * The async/await syntax is a more recent addition to JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations.
 * It provides a way to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, making it easier to read and maintain.
 *  The async keyword is used to mark a function as asynchronous, and the await keyword is used to wait for a promise to resolve before continuing execution.
 * For example:
*/
    async function showTheData(){
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) =>{
            setTimeout(() => {
                const myJob=['Software','Hardware','Astronot'];
                resolve(myJob);
            }, 3000);
        })
    }
   
    async function randomMethod(){//to invoke async method your method should be async.
    const show=await showTheData();
    console.log(show);
    }
   
   randomMethod();
//In this example, we define an async function called "showTheData()" that returns a promise that resolves with the fetched data after a delay of 3 seconds.
// We then define another async function called "randomMethod()" that uses the await keyword to wait for the promise to resolve before logging the fetched data to the console.

/** 6. Handling errors with try/catch:-

 * In async/await code, errors can be handled using the try/catch syntax, just like in synchronous code.
*/
//  For example:-

async function showTheData2(){
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(()=>{
            const mySkills=new Error('Failed to fetch');
            reject(mySkills);
        },4000)
    })
}

async function display(){
    try{
        const show2 = await showTheData2();
    console.log(show2);
    }
    catch(reason){
        console.log(reason);
    }
}

display();
//In this example, we define an async function called "showTheData2()" that returns a promise that rejects with an error after a delay of 4 seconds.
// We then define another async function called display() that uses the try/catch syntax to handle the error and log it to the console.

/** 7. async/await with multiple promises:

 *async/await also allows for more complex asynchronous workflows involving multiple promises.
  We can use the Promise.all() method to wait for multiple promises to resolve before continuing execution.
   For example:-
*/
async function getThatData1(){
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(()=>{
        const data1={name :'Abhi', rno:012};
        resolve(data1);
        },5000)
    })
}
async function getThatData2(){
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(()=>{
        const data2={job:'Engineer',sal:2000};
        resolve(data2);
        },4000)
    })
}
async function main(){
    try{
        const [got1, got2]= await Promise.all([getThatData1(), getThatData2()]);
        console.log(got1, got2);
    }    
    catch(reason){
        console.log(reason);
    }
}
main();
//In this example, we define two async functions that each return a promise that resolves with some data after a delay.
// We then define another async function called main() that uses Promise.all() to wait for both promises to resolve before logging both sets of data to the console.

/** 8. Conclusion:-
 
 * async/await is a powerful tool for writing more readable and maintainable asynchronous code in JavaScript.
 * By using the async keyword to mark functions as asynchronous and the await keyword to wait for promises to resolve,
 *  we can write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code.
 *  Additionally, the try/catch syntax allows us to handle errors in a familiar way,
 *  and Promise.all() provides a way to handle complex workflows involving multiple promises.
