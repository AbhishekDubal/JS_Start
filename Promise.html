/*** What are Promises in JavaScript?

* Promises are a way of handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
* Asynchronous operations are those that don't happen immediately and may take some time to complete. 
* Examples of asynchronous operations in JavaScript include fetching data from a server, reading/writing to a file, or performing animations on a web page.

* To handle these operations, JavaScript provides a construct called a "Promise".
* A "promise" represents a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved at some point in the future.

* A promise has three states:
        1)Pending:-The initial state, the promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected.

        2)Fulfilled:- The operation completed successfully, and the promise now has a resulting value.

        3)Rejected:- The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure.

  \*\*\ Creating a Promise:-
*  To create a new promise, you use the "Promise" constructor.
*  The constructor takes a single argument: a function that accepts two parameters, `resolve` and `reject`.
*  These parameters are functions that you call to either fulfill or reject the promise.
*/
// Here's an example of how to create a promise that resolves with the value of "Hello World!":-
const myPromise =  new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
    resolve("HEllo There! I'm Abhishek.");
})

//In this example, we call the resolve function with the value "HEllo There! I'm Abhishek.".
// This fulfills the promise, and the "then" method can be used to handle the fulfilled value.

//***Handling a Fulfilled Promise:-

//* To handle the fulfillment of a promise, you can use the "then" method.
//* The "then" method takes "two" parameters:-
//* a function to handle the fulfilled value,
//* and a function to handle any errors that may occur.


myPromise.then((value)=>{
    console.log(value); //output: HEllo There! I'm Abhishek.
});

//In this example, we pass a function that logs the fulfilled value to the console.

/*** Handling a Rejected Promise:-

 * If the operation that a promise represents fails,
 * you can reject the promise by calling the "reject" function with a reason for the failure.
*/
//Here's an example of how to create a promise that rejects with an error message:-

const myPromise2 =new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    reject("Something went wrong!");
});
// To handle the rejection of a promise, you can use the catch method.
//* The catch method takes a "single" parameter:-
//* a function to handle the reason for the rejection.

//* Here's an example of how to handle the rejection of the promise we created earlier:

myPromise2.catch((reason) => {
    console.error(reason);  //output: Something went wrong!
});
//In this example, we pass a function that logs the reason for the rejection to the console.

/**Chaining Promises:-

 * Promises can be chained together to create a sequence of asynchronous operations.
 * When one operation completes, the next operation in the chain can begin.
 * 
 * To chain promises, you use the "then" method to return a new promise.
 *  This new promise will be resolved with the value returned by the function passed to "then".
 */
 //* Here's an example of how to chain two promises together:

    const firstPromise =new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        resolve(100);
    });

    const secondPromise =firstPromise.then((value) => {
        return value +200;
    });

    secondPromise.then((value)=>{
        console.log(value); //output: 300
    });
